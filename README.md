## Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Creating the work day scheduler allowed me to developing and utilise my jQuery skills, combining HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery and Jquery UIs to build a useful and practical app. The project makes use of Jquery syntax and the moment third-party API to create a time reference as a basis for the project, allowing the work schedule to be interactice and updatable throughout the workday. The user can save notes to local storage, with these notes being rendered to the page meaning that they are refresh resistent will reappear on reopening the page. The page also updates visually throughout the day, with the colour of timeslots changing in relation to the time, allowing users to successfully manage and stay on top of their schedule. On completion of the project I have learned and developed my Jquery  and logic skils. 

## Installation

N/A.

## Usage

Add notes to desired timeslots and click the save button for these to be saved and reappear on refresh or reopening of the page. Use the colours of the time slot to keep on top of what tasks need to be focused on throughout the day.
